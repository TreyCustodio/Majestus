#  Majestus (WIP)
This is a huge, independent passion project. The game isn't currently in the most playable state.<br>
Expect to see a full-fledged demo including the first two areas by Januray 1st, 2025.<br>

On a Windows device, execute the run.bat file to run the game (this just runs py main.py in the command line)<br>
By starting a **New Game**, you may catch a glimpse of how I display the colorful introductory text.<br>
By selecting **Continue**, you can explore the first area of the game, including various enemies and a shop.
